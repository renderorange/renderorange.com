## Relics of an interesting person

What a find!  It's tapes like this that really make me happy to do this.  All of these wonderful little relics, memories long forgotten, telling the story of a person.

Side one starts out with a dictation where we learn quite a lot about this person.

- Recorded on Friday March 14th
- That day she went for a Harley ride with her neighbor, Jim Wagner
- She and Jim went to a place called Ozark to get BBQ
- Ozark was closed, so they went to JR Pawn Shop where she found something special that used to belong to her

So far I haven't been able to find where Ozark or JR Pawn Shop were located.  Maybe Birmingham Alabama, but I'm yet to find any conclusive evidence.

March 14th was on a Friday in 1975, which based on the later mention of the Sony Mini Recorder m430, was not when this was recorded.  The m430 was first released in 1999, so we can assume the Friday March 14th in 2008 was probably the one.

We end side one with a recording of two men, seemingly recorded without their knowledge, working on a computer.

> "Turn it off first.  [inaudible]  Do what I said.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about."
> 
> *-- Abusive man who's probably dead now*

## God dangit Budrow

Side two has some of my favorite slices of forgotten life, answering machine messages.  Although these messages don't yield as great as the last answering machine tape, they're still enjoyable.

We follow it up with a long recording of what sounds like someone hammering wood, then some sounds of the outdoors, perhaps from a backyard or open window, and maybe a Bee buzzing by.

> "God dangit Budrow."
> 
> *-- Woman presumably to her dog causing some lovely mischief*

We then have some testing where we get some more juicy tidbits of information.

I extracted the testing section into a different file since it was recorded at a different speed.

> "Testing testing testing testing one two three testing."
> 
> "Test check check test test and check one two three."
> 
> "This is a test of the Sony Mini Recorder the m430 that I absconded with from my nephew Brian.  And I’m going to use this for uh various recordings.   But I have to find the right tapes.  End of check and test."

> *-- A guitar playing, Harley riding, BBQ eating, dog loving, lady*

Enjoy.
