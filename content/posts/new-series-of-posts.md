## A new hobby

I spend a fair amount of my freetime researching and experimenting with old technologies to find interesting sounds.  While searching, I've stumbled across a corner of forgotten life; memories packed away, slowly degrading in basements and storage containers.

These beauties, microcassettes, with hours of dictation, random thoughts, answering machine messages, and candid slices of unscripted life, are all waiting to be listened to and shared.

I'll be extracting, archiving, then sharing the juicy bits.  Hope you enjoy.
