## A constant battle

As a creative person I regularly find myself at odds with perfectionism.  Sometimes it looks like researching an idea for months to ultimately park it on the shelf.  Sometimes, but not often, I get the courage to just push in and try, for better or worse, regardless of the potential for failure.

Although completely rewarding, extracting and archiving long forgotten microcassette recordings was always a side tangent to a different goal, making microcassette tape loops.  

## And then I dove in

Last night I found a pretty interesting sound as I was playing with some new effects pedals.  I decided it was time to dive in and try recording it onto a tape loop.  Why not?  Let's do it!

## The pedal setup in constant rotation

My current pedal setup for this clip:

Telecaster > EQ > long analog voiced delay/reverb > long digital delay/reverb > another really long delay/reverb (but with a swelling bitcrusher effect) > tone box > analog mixer > 1977 Olympus Pearlcorder SD 

I'll add more about the Olympus Pearlcorder some other time.  I picked it up from a vendor who completely rebuilt and serviced it.  It's an absolute beast of a unit and the recordings are excellent.

In the recording you'll notice the loss of tone due to the limited bandwidth of the microcassette, as well as the loop splice.

Enjoy.
