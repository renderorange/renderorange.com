## He's hurting the people who voted for him

No one will remember what Trump did to help the country once all of this DOGE nonsense is over.  Objectively the numbers won’t lie as much as he will about what happened.

In the end, all he’ll have done is cause worry and suffering for hard working middle class Americans.  For everyone not entranced by his lies, he’ll still only be seen as a conman.  Because that’s what he is, a conman.

## He's a bully at best

He played a businessman on TV, and that’s it.  He’s not good at business, he’s not bright, he’s not charismatic.  He rules by fear because he doesn’t know how to inspire people.  At best, he’s the meathead bully everyone complied with.

That isn’t the type of person you want in charge of anything.
