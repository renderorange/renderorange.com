## Who believes this?

Our Sith Lord and savior is now "starting a task force to root out anti-Christian bias in all our federal departments and prosecute anti-Christian violence across the nation."

Anti-Christian violence?  Where is that happening?  I'll wait.

Also, I'm pretty sure we have something in the constitution about this.  Surely, something, somewhere, in the very first amendment, about the US government being religiously neutral.

## Trump has the best of the low numbers!

Let's also remember that Trump's polling numbers for his first month are shockingly low, [worse than any president since 1953](https://news.gallup.com/poll/656891/trump-job-approval-rating-congress-jumps.aspx).  This is simply a ploy to pander to the Christian right.

Surely we're smarter than this, right?  Right?
