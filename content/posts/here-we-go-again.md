## An intro of sorts

Well, here we go again.  I've started and retired more blogs than I can remember, and honestly, apart from my Appalachian Trail content, there really isn't much I wish I still had.

Here you’ll find posts about my several hobbies, new projects I’m working on, political and business ramblings, and random stuff I enjoy.
