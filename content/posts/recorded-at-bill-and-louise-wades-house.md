## Estate sales are sad

A couple weeks ago my wife and I were driving to an errand and noticed several signs advertising an estate sale.  Without much thought we looked at each other and both said, why not?  I'd never been to one and didn't know what to expect.

As we walked through each room in the house it was clear a couple had lived there.  There was an antique doll collection, men's and women's coats, shoes, and boots.  In the basement there were several old tools, typewriters, and several parts for small electronics repair.  There were some really neat antiques like an old wash basin and washing vanity.  A red "world's best grandpa" hat hung on the wall.  These people were loved.

## This will be us some day

Looking through the remnants of these people's lives together, it was hard not to think about the interactions these people had with these things.  The shoes they put on everyday, the dishes they used to eat their meals, the books and keepsakes they may have found meaningful.  The things we were looking through were the wake left in the water after the boat passed through, telling stories about people who could no longer tell them.

"This will be us some day" my wife said.  "Strangers will go through our things, scattering the leftovers of our lives."

## On our way out

As we were finishing the walkthrough, in the basement, I saw a big revolving stack of cassette tapes.  $10 dollars.  I scooped it up under my arm and shot my wife a scheming glance.

One particular tape stood out.

The label on the side of the tape case read, "Recorded at Bill and Louise Wade's House.  420 Homeplace Dr, Salem, VA. Aug 28 - 91."  The label on the tape read, "Duke - Jesse - Bob - Steve - Bill."

## They weren't hard to find

Some quick research indicated that the Bill from the tape label was the Bill from the house.

Bill served in the Navy for three years during World War II.  He worked as an engine carpenter for 40 years.

He died in 2018 aged 92.

Elsie Louise Daniel Wade loved playing piano and worked at several places around the Roanoke Valley.

She died in 2020 aged 93.

Bill and Louise Wade had two sons and were married for 70 years.

## In all its nearly forgotten glory

Assuming the label on the tape was the same person, Bill played an instrument on the tape recording.  Based on the other tapes in the lot, Bill may have played guitar, since there were more tapes of guitar players than anything else.

This was the only recording of the group in the tape lot.  Assuming Bill was the one running the equipment in their basement, this may have been the only recording of them playing together as a group.  And unless they were all seasoned musicians who regularly played with strangers, it's most likely they played together regularly and practiced all of those songs.  Duke, Jesse, Bob, Steve, and Bill may have been friends, since they were all listed on the tape with first names only.

I don't know what their band was called.  Here for you in all its nearly forgotten glory is some good old timey pickin and a grinnin, played for you by Duke, Jesse, Bob, Steve, and Bill, recorded at Bill and Louise Wade's House on Aug 28th, 1991.
