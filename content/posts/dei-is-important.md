## Put on your empathy hat

Let’s imagine for a minute that you grew up being told you’d never be good at golf.  Your parents, and their parents, and their parents, all told the same thing, that golf just wasn’t for them.

Let’s also imagine there were people driving around where you live, actively telling you and everyone around you that they’ll never be good at golf, that they shouldn’t even try.

Then one day you find an old set of golf clubs and decide to hit a couple balls.  You actually love it!  So you go to the local golf course, step up to the main desk in the lobby, and ask how to join.  The person behind the desk laughs and says, don’t you know, you’ll never be good at golf, it’s not for you!  See, they also grew up being told that you and people like you would never be good at golf.  And their parents, and their parents, and their parents before them, all told the same thing.

What are the chances you’ll keep playing golf?  Slim to none.

## Why is DEI so important?

The reason diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are important is because there are a lot of people who grow up in a world where they’re told they’ll never be more than what they are now, and they shouldn’t even try.  And the people who aren’t them are told the same thing, that “those people” will never be like them.

And the people driving around actively telling those people they’ll never be more, those are the police, and that’s systematic racism.  And while we’re at it, that’s why critical race theory exists and why it’s important.

Why are racist white people fighting to stop those things?  Because they like the system where they’re the only people who get to play.
