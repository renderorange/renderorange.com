## A strongly worded letter

I had an absolute blast with this tape, not only because of the content, but because of the detective work finding who this person was.

In this sixteen and a half minute clip, a woman dictates a letter to what's presumably an administrative assistant.  This strongly worded letter is calling out the university over denying a promotion of a fellow professor that she feels deserves the promotion.

I was able to find the following information about her after piecing together clues she leaves in the dictation.

```
Dr. Sharon Bannister
Full Professor of European History for 30 years
University of Findlay
Died in 2004 at the age of 60.
```

The way she edits her thoughts while dictating is quite something.  What a great listen.

> "I believe that the role of the division chair, in such manners as promotions and tenure, is being eroded.  I have been told that new faculty in the international center have been told by a colleague, 'You don't have to please Jean. Please the members of faculty affairs.'  Something is wrong when such an analysis is being made."
> 
> "Consider for example that, no no just forget that.  I'll finish that one later.  New paragraph."
> 
> "... and also to look, oh geez, forget that.  In our area, in our areas, make it plural."
> 
> *-- Dr. Sharon Bannister.  circa 1991*

The tape ends with reminders to her administrative assistant.  Sharon also presumably liked grandfather clocks.
