## The Mark of quality

This is the tape that got me started down the trail of listening to tapes.

There's an almost voyeuristic quality listening to this, like I'm not supposed to be listening to someone's voicemails, but especially this one.

We start off like you'd expect with voicemail messages.

> "Mark, if you're there pick up the phone.  Hello?  Alright bye."
> 
> "Mark. (click beep)"
> 
> "Mark, this is Russ.  Must not be there."
>
> "Anybody there?  Hello.  Guess nobody's home.  Goodbye."
>
> *-- Russ (who along with Rodge, apparently calls Mark a lot)*

Then boom, the motherload.  Mark records a call of himself talking with his wife.

> Mark: "Um, I gotta let you know summum, okay?  Um, I'm legally binded to let you know that I've closed our checking account, and not to write any checks because they'll bounce."
> 
> Wife: "WHAT?!"
> ...

Answering machine tapes are the really juicy ones.
