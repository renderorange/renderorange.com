## can one shield too much?

This part of the project was a lot of fun.  I spent a fair amount of time researching materials and proper shielding techniques.  There are many differing opinions about the effectiveness of shielding and when it actually matters.  In the end, the copper tape was cheap, and it was fun applying it.

I covered each cavity with the copper tape then ran a small copper wire between the jack cavity and the main body.  Using the multimeter, each cavity and wall tests conductive to every other cavity and wall.

I also re-shielded the buttom[1] of the pickguard, ensuring I overlapped a couple of screw holes to connect it to all cavities.

## intentionally inflicted damage

To make for a buttery smooth neck, I then applied butter.  Nope, I lightly sanded the neck with 220 grit sanding blocks.

So I guess it would be more accurate to say it feels smooth like silk.  Butter isn't all that smooth to the touch; it doesn't glide very easily, at least.

## here comes the tedious part

Finally, the final finale.  Soldering the electronics and pickups.  The pickups I bought came with a wiring diagram, which I'm just going to follow.  Like the shielding, there are lots of opinions about wiring the tone pots between the pickups, and several different "styles" you can use to get different effects.  I'm just going to follow the instructions.  I assume the maker of the pickups knows what'll produce the best sound.

More to come.
