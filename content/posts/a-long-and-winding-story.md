## Gold amongst a lot of noise

One of my latest microcassette lot purchases consists mostly of recorded lectures from an unknown college (maybe Yale).  Each tape has the lecture name written on the label; greek, greek #2, hellenistic greek, greek 2nd, futurist, late hellenistic greek.

Most of the content on the six tapes is barely audible; a literal Charlie Brown's teacher.  I'm not sure how the person who owned these tapes got any good notes from the recordings.

So far, amongst the noise, I've found one golden nugget.  A long and winding story of what appears to be a short trip by a group of students in or around Yale (mentioned [Claire's Corner Copia](https://www.clairescornercopia.com/) and two [Gutenberg Bibles](https://beineckegutenberg.yale.edu/yale-copy)).  Apparently there were disco naps, poop dip, and a lot of farting.
