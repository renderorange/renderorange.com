## About me

Hi, I'm Blaine. I enjoy reading, building software, hiking, making music, and playing games.

My wife and I, along with our two wonderful dogs, Willow and Piper, live in Salem, VA, USA in the beautiful Roanoke Valley of the [Appalachian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains).  I work remotely as a [software engineer](https://renderorange.com/resume.html).

I'm a [progressive democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States) and [secular humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism).  I spend my freetime [working for progressive change in local government](https://salemdemsva.com).
